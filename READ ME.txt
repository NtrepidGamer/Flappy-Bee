Thanks for downloading my awsome python project

this project is made by:
NtrepidGamer!

For macOS and linux users you need to run the non-transparent version as the transparent version does not work. I used windows for this project and windows code for the game.

instructions macOS/linux:
1. chmod +x dependancies[OS type].sh
1. run the dependancies installer according to your system with ./dependancies[OS type].sh
    - optional: download python seperatly except on macOS
2. if no errors do NOT delete the dependancies installer
3. run the game

instructions windows:
1. run the dependancies installer according to your system
2. if no errors do NOT delete the dependancies installer
3. have fun!
